# This is my first knowledge check of Code Louisville!

## First Assignment:
For this assignment, i'm going to work with Pandas to explore a little more of the data manipulation and computation side of things.

## Instructions:
To complete the first knowledge check, I will do the following:
Create a GitHub repo called "data_1_checks". Upload ALL knowledge checks to this repo in the future.
Send that link to my mentor so they can check it when you finish the assignment.
Make a .py (or .ipynb) file that contains the following and do the following:
  * Pull in data from an API. Here's a list of public APIs that don't require Auth keys, though if you have another API you want to use feel free: https://apipheny.io/free-api/
  * Find and print TWO descriptive statistics about your data. Like the mean() or sum() of a column to the number of different categories, to the number of null values in a column.
  * Write a query in Pandas to select a particular set of your data. Use a mask or with .query(), to pull out a subset based on any parameter.
  * Select and print the SECOND AND THIRD columns of the data frame.
  * Select and print the FIRST 4 rows of the data frame.
